Keep your Erstwilder companion neatly tucked away in this box when not being worn, avoid contact with perfumes, lotions, water, and excessive sunlight and you’ll have a trusted friend for years to come.\n\nPlease note that for any design with etched linework, particularly on mirror resins, and especially where lines curve, may have a slightly jagged or uneven appearance. This feature is due to the nature of the materials and an expected part of the process of production. Also note, mirrored acrylic cannot be polished or tumbled during the production process so it will not feature the smooth edge that you would expect on other resin pieces."

            "answer": "When cleaning or polishing hard enamel pins, use a microfiber cloth and non-abrasive polishing cream. Remove the rubber clutch before you begin but careful handling the exposed pin. Begin with a small area to ensure the polishing cream isn’t too harsh on the pin. Proceed from there but do be gentle and treat them with care to avoid damage. To prevent fading over time and maintain durability of your enamel pin, avoid excessive exposure to light and heat. Enamel pins are also best stored with their rubber clutches on and spaced from one another to prevent scratching."
